# Starting the Year Right

I woke up this morning and I thought, OK here we go. It was later than I usually run and my stomach was lightweight bugging me but I was determined to go for a run. When I got out to start the new year with that crisp 8am air and it felt great! For a mile...

After that first mile, my stomach started up again. I thought maybe I could keep going but apparently the New Year's Eve anchovie & garlic pizza had other plans. (Yes that really was my last dinner of 2018.) I booked it back to the house toilet and felt defeated. Great start to the new year, huh?

But I already knew that morning that I couldn't let this be how the year started. I needed to go again that day.


So after an IKEA trip (yay IKEA furniture!) and a late lunch, I went for another run! This time did about 4.5 - 5 km though it looks like my GPS crapped out on me on the 1st half mile. But it still ended up being the most I've ran in one day for months! It's got me thinking maybe I could do some two-a-days in the near future...
