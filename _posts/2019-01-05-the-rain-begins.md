# The Rain Begins

Wasn't actually planning on running today; figured since it would rain today would be my rest day. But when I woke up and saw the weather want bad and tomorrow likely will be, I went out for a short easy run. Barely a drizzle when it did rain. The wind was strong at the coastline but it wasn't too bad in the residential zone.
