# Happy Thirdsday!

3rd day of the month + Thursday = [Thirdsday!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NinrTW1Bx2Y)

Today I was real excited because it was the wife and my vacation trip to Capitola! We like to call Capitola the older (interpret that as "calmer") Santa Cruz. It'll be nice to just relax and explore somewhere we feel comfortable and familiar with.

I was debating if I'd keep up trying to run while on vacation but I realized I was thinking of this all wrong. Going for a run isn't supposed to be a chore and it really hasn't been. Sure when I think about exercising in the abstract it plays out in my mind as something I "have to do". But as I've been doing it consistently, I've been feeling pretty good. In fact, I might actually feel more overall energetic considering that I'm actually waking up at about the same time. I'll have to see how this little experiment turns out.
