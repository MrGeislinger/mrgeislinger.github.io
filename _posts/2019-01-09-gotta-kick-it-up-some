# Gotta Kick It Up Some!

Wow, I've been really bad yesterday and today. Yesterday I did just 5k but today I didn't even get to 3.5k! 

I'm hoping to make my goals, one of them being 80K by the 15th, but there's no way I can make it at this rate! Tomorrow I have to try for at least 6k but ideally 8k. It's just been hard when I feel that I'm not getting enough sleep. Stupid time, never enough...
