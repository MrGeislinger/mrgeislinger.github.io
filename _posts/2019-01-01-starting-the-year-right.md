# Starting the Year Right

I woke up this morning and I thought, OK here we go. It was later than I usually run and my stomach was lightweight bugging me but I was determined to go for a run. When I got out to start the new year with that crisp 8am air and it felt great! For a mile...

After that first mile, my stomach started up again. I thought maybe I could keep going but apparently the New Year's Eve anchovie & garlic pizza had other plans. (Yes that really was my last dinner of 2018.) I booked it back to the house toilet and felt defeated. Great start to the new year, huh?

But I already knew that morning that I couldn't let this be how the year started. I needed to go again that day.
